## Organizing Trib Data

This is a Repository for joining HOBO data for multiple depths for Bethel and Marceline.

### Bethel

Bethel has HOBO data for depths 0.5 - 2.5 in 0.5 increments 


Bethel has current file a previous member worked on called Bethel_HOBOTemp 2022-2023. This is the file I am basing
the code out of.


### Marceline

Marceline has HOBO data for depths 0 - 5.75. These increments are usually 1m except for an additional 4.75 and 5.75m
There is a current file called Marceline_Hobo_Data Combined but it's not too organized
